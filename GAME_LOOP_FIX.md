# 🔄 GAME LOOP FIX - Stops Infinite Retry

## The Problem (From Your Console):

```
[GAME] Timeout: Game stuck in starting state, resetting...
❌ Not settling - conditions not met
📌 Queuing seed for when ready: 0xf5cffbd8...
🎮 Auto-starting new round with seed: 0xf5cffbd8...
Failed to start game
[Loop repeats forever]
```

**What was happening:**
1. Game shows wallet popup
2. User doesn't approve (or takes too long)
3. Timeout (10s) resets game to 'ready'
4. Chart generates new seed
5. Game auto-starts with new seed
6. **GOTO step 1** ♾️

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. Increased Timeout: 10s → 60s
- Gives user time to approve wallet
- Was killing game too fast before

### 2. Added User Rejection Detection
```typescript
const isUserRejection = error?.message?.includes('User rejected') ||
                        error?.code === 4001;
```

### 3. Prevent Auto-Restart After Rejection
```typescript
// Set flag when user rejects
sessionStorage.setItem('preventAutoStart', 'true');

// Check flag before auto-start
if (preventAutoStart) {
    console.log('⏸️ Auto-start prevented');
    return;
}

// Clear after 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => sessionStorage.removeItem('preventAutoStart'), 5000);
```

## 🎯 Now When User Rejects:

**Before:**
1. User clicks "Cancel" on Petra popup
2. Game resets
3. NEW round starts immediately
4. Popup shows again
5. **Infinite loop** 😱

**After:**
1. User clicks "Cancel" on Petra popup
2. Game resets
3. **Auto-start is BLOCKED for 5 seconds**
4. User can manually start when ready
5. **No more spam!** ✅

---

## 📋 What to Test:

1. **Connect wallet**
2. **Click Cancel** on the first popup
3. **Verify:** No new popup appears
4. **Wait 5 seconds**
5. Chart should show "waiting" state
6. **Click chart to start** manually when ready

---

## 🔧 Additional Improvements:

### Timeout Handling
- Old: 10 second hard timeout
- New: 60 second timeout with better logging

### Error Messages
- User rejection: Soft warning
- Real errors: Full error details logged

### State Management
- Clears queued seed on error
- Prevents stuck "starting" state
- No more wallet disconnect during settlement

## 🎮 User Experience:

**Old flow:**
- Popup → Cancel → Popup → Cancel → Popup → (hell)

**New flow:**
- Popup → Cancel → **Game waits**
- User can start manually when ready
- Or wait 5s and chart restarts cleanly
