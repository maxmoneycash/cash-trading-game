# Verifiable Random Candlestick Generator for Aptos Hackathon
## Technical Architecture & Implementation Plan

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture for a high-frequency trading game built on Aptos, designed specifically for hackathon submission. We prioritize rapid development and user experience by implementing chart generation off-chain while using Aptos smart contracts exclusively for financial settlement. This hybrid approach allows us to deliver a functional product within hackathon constraints while maintaining a clear upgrade path to full decentralization using Shelby Protocol post-launch.

## 1. System Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Core Design Decisions

| Design Aspect | Hackathon Implementation | Production Goal | Rationale |
|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Chart Generation | Off-chain TypeScript server | On-chain seed + Shelby storage | Speed to market, 65ms update requirement |
| Randomness Source | Server-side PRNG with published seeds | Aptos randomness API | Avoid gas costs during testing |
| Data Storage | PostgreSQL + Redis cache | Shelby Protocol DA layer | Existing infrastructure, quick deployment |
| Financial Settlement | Aptos Move contracts | Same | Critical for trust and transparency |
| User Authentication | JWT + Aptos wallet | Same | Hybrid approach for Web2 UX |
| Real-time Updates | WebSocket server | WebSocket + Shelby reads | Already implemented in codebase |

### 1.2 Component Architecture

The system consists of five primary services that communicate through well-defined interfaces:

| Service | Technology | Responsibility | Aptos Integration |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| API Server | Express.js on port 3000 | REST endpoints for trades, auth, metrics | Reads blockchain state via RPC |
| WebSocket Server | ws library on port 3001 | Real-time chart streaming, order updates | None (pure off-chain) |
| Game Engine | TypeScript worker | Chart generation, game logic, round management | Submits settlement transactions |
| Frontend | Next.js on port 3002 | Mobile-first UI, chart rendering, wallet connection | Aptos Wallet Adapter |
| Settlement Contract | Move on Aptos | Deposits, withdrawals, round settlements | Native blockchain component |

## 2. Data Flow Architecture

### 2.1 Complete Game Round Lifecycle

The game operates in 30-second rounds with continuous chart generation. Here's the complete data flow:

| Step | Component | Action | Data Format | Destination |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Game Engine | Generate round seed | `{roundId: string, seed: bytes32, timestamp: u64}` | PostgreSQL |
| 2 | Game Engine | Expand seed to 460 candles | `Candle[]` array | Redis cache |
| 3 | Game Engine | Emit round start event | `{roundId, startTime, seedHash}` | WebSocket Server |
| 4 | WebSocket Server | Broadcast to subscribers | JSON message | Connected clients |
| 5 | Frontend | Request chart stream | `{subscribe: "chart:roundId"}` | WebSocket Server |
| 6 | WebSocket Server | Stream candles at 65ms intervals | `{time, open, high, low, close}` | Frontend |
| 7 | Frontend | User opens position | `{side: "long", amount: 100}` | API Server |
| 8 | API Server | Validate and record trade | Database write | PostgreSQL |
| 9 | Game Engine | Calculate round results | `Map<userId, pnl>` | Internal state |
| 10 | Game Engine | Submit settlement to Aptos | Move transaction | Blockchain |
| 11 | Move Contract | Update user balances | State change | On-chain storage |
| 12 | API Server | Emit settlement events | `{userId, pnl, newBalance}` | WebSocket Server |

### 2.2 Financial Flow Through Aptos

All monetary operations flow through a master Aptos account controlled by the game server. This centralized approach is acceptable for hackathon MVP but will be decentralized in production.

| Operation | Initiator | Aptos Transaction | Contract Function | Result |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Deposit | User | Direct transfer to game wallet | `deposit(user: address, amount: u64)` | Credits user's game balance |
| Withdrawal Request | User via UI | None (queued) | N/A | Added to withdrawal queue |
| Batch Settlement | Game Engine (every 10 rounds) | Single transaction | `settle_round(results: vector<Settlement>)` | Updates all balances atomically |
| Withdrawal Execution | Game Engine (hourly) | Batch transaction | `process_withdrawals(requests: vector<Withdrawal>)` | Transfers APT to users |
| House Fee Collection | Game Engine (daily) | Transfer to treasury | `collect_fees(amount: u64)` | Moves accumulated fees |

## 3. Aptos Smart Contract Architecture

### 3.1 Contract Structure

The Move contracts handle only financial operations, deliberately avoiding game logic to minimize gas costs and complexity:

```
modules/
├── game_wallet.move       # Master wallet management
├── user_balances.move     # User balance tracking
├── round_settlement.move  # Batch settlement logic
├── withdrawal_queue.move  # Withdrawal request handling
└── admin_controls.move    # Emergency pause, fee adjustment
```

### 3.2 Key Data Structures

| Structure | Fields | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `GameWallet` | `balance: u64`<br>`total_deposits: u64`<br>`total_withdrawals: u64`<br>`house_fees: u64` | Master wallet accounting |
| `UserBalance` | `available: u64`<br>`locked: u64`<br>`total_won: u64`<br>`total_lost: u64` | Per-user financial state |
| `RoundResult` | `round_id: vector<u8>`<br>`settlements: vector<Settlement>`<br>`timestamp: u64` | Round settlement record |
| `Settlement` | `user: address`<br>`pnl: i64`<br>`final_balance: u64` | Individual user settlement |
| `WithdrawalRequest` | `user: address`<br>`amount: u64`<br>`requested_at: u64`<br>`status: u8` | Pending withdrawal |

### 3.3 Contract Security Model

Since the game server has full control during hackathon phase, we implement these safeguards:

| Security Measure | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| Daily withdrawal limits | 1000 APT per user per day | Prevent drain attacks |
| Minimum withdrawal delay | 1 hour from request | Allow manual intervention |
| Maximum round settlement | 10,000 APT total PnL | Cap exposure per round |
| Emergency pause | Admin-only function | Stop all operations |
| Withdrawal whitelist | Optional KYC addresses | Compliance ready |

## 4. Off-Chain Chart Generation System

### 4.1 Algorithm Components

The chart generation system creates realistic price movements with controlled randomness. Instead of true randomness, we use deterministic generation from seeds for reproducibility:

| Component | Responsibility | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Base Trend Generator | Creates underlying price direction | Sine waves with random amplitude 0.5-2% |
| Volatility Layer | Adds market-like noise | Gaussian distribution σ=0.3% |
| Event Injector | Adds pumps and dumps | 0.5% pump probability, 0.2% dump probability |
| Liquidation Engine | Forces stop-losses | Triggers at ±5% from entry |
| House Edge Calculator | Ensures negative expected value | -2% drift over 30 seconds |

### 4.2 Candle Generation Pipeline

| Stage | Input | Processing | Output | Timing |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|---------|
| Seed Generation | Round ID | SHA256(roundId + serverSecret + timestamp) | 32-byte seed | Start of round |
| Batch Expansion | Seed + batch number | ChaCha20 PRNG initialized with seed | 10 candles | Every 650ms |
| Candle Construction | Previous close + random values | Apply trend, volatility, events | OHLC data | Every 65ms |
| Serialization | Candle object | JSON stringify + compression | Byte array | Immediate |
| Caching | Serialized data | Store in Redis with TTL=3600s | Cache key | Immediate |
| Streaming | Cache key + client request | Retrieve and decompress | WebSocket message | On demand |

### 4.3 Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Current (Off-chain) | Future (Shelby) | Requirement |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Generation latency | <1ms | 120ms (on-chain seed) | <65ms |
| Streaming latency | <5ms | <10ms | <20ms |
| Concurrent rounds | Unlimited | Unlimited | >100 |
| Storage per round | 45KB | 45KB | N/A |
| Bandwidth per player | 30kbps | 30kbps | <100kbps |
| Server cost per round | $0.0001 | $0.001 (includes gas) | <$0.01 |

## 5. WebSocket Real-Time Architecture

### 5.1 Message Protocol

The WebSocket server handles bi-directional communication with strict message typing:

| Message Type | Direction | Payload Structure | Frequency |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| `subscribe` | Client→Server | `{method: "SUBSCRIBE", params: ["chart:roundId"]}` | Once per round |
| `unsubscribe` | Client→Server | `{method: "UNSUBSCRIBE", params: ["chart:roundId"]}` | On disconnect |
| `candle` | Server→Client | `{type: "candle", data: {time, o, h, l, c, v}}` | Every 65ms |
| `roundStart` | Server→Client | `{type: "roundStart", data: {roundId, startTime}}` | Every 30s |
| `roundEnd` | Server→Client | `{type: "roundEnd", data: {roundId, results}}` | Every 30s |
| `trade` | Server→Client | `{type: "trade", data: {id, side, price, pnl}}` | On settlement |
| `balance` | Server→Client | `{type: "balance", data: {available, locked}}` | On change |

### 5.2 Subscription Management

| Resource | Subscription Pattern | Maximum Subscribers | Cleanup Strategy |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Chart data | `chart:{roundId}` | 10,000 per round | Auto-unsubscribe after round |
| User trades | `trades:{userId}` | 1 per user | Unsubscribe on disconnect |
| Market depth | `depth:{market}` | Unlimited | Redis pub/sub fanout |
| Global stats | `stats:global` | Unlimited | Broadcast every 1s |

## 6. Database Architecture

### 6.1 PostgreSQL Schema

The database uses the existing Prisma schema with game-specific extensions:

| Table | Purpose | Key Columns | Indexes |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `users` | User accounts | `id, email, aptos_address, created_at` | `email`, `aptos_address` |
| `rounds` | Game rounds | `id, seed_hash, start_time, end_time, status` | `status, start_time` |
| `trades` | User positions | `id, user_id, round_id, side, amount, entry_price, exit_price, pnl` | `user_id, round_id` |
| `candles` | Chart data archive | `round_id, index, time, open, high, low, close` | `round_id, index` |
| `deposits` | Deposit history | `id, user_id, aptos_tx_hash, amount, status` | `user_id, status` |
| `withdrawals` | Withdrawal requests | `id, user_id, amount, requested_at, processed_at, aptos_tx_hash` | `user_id, status` |
| `settlements` | Round settlements | `id, round_id, user_id, pnl, aptos_tx_hash` | `round_id`, `aptos_tx_hash` |

### 6.2 Redis Cache Strategy

| Key Pattern | Data Type | TTL | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|-----|---------|
| `round:active` | STRING | None | Current round ID |
| `round:{id}:candles` | LIST | 1 hour | Candle data for streaming |
| `round:{id}:trades` | HASH | 1 hour | Active trades in round |
| `user:{id}:balance` | STRING | None | Cached balance |
| `user:{id}:session` | HASH | 24 hours | JWT session data |
| `stats:global` | HASH | None | Real-time statistics |
| `leaderboard:daily` | ZSET | 24 hours | Daily rankings |

## 7. Authentication & Wallet Integration

### 7.1 Hybrid Authentication Flow

The system uses JWT for session management while requiring Aptos wallet for financial operations:

| Step | Action | Component | Verification |
|------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | User connects Aptos wallet | Frontend | Wallet signature verification |
| 2 | Frontend sends signed message | API Server | Verify signature matches address |
| 3 | Server creates user record | PostgreSQL | Link address to user ID |
| 4 | Server issues JWT | API Server | Contains userId and aptos_address |
| 5 | Subsequent requests use JWT | All endpoints | Standard Bearer token |
| 6 | Financial operations require wallet signature | Deposit/Withdraw | Additional signature verification |

### 7.2 Wallet Integration Points

| Operation | Wallet Requirement | Fallback | Security Check |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| View charts | None | N/A | None |
| Place trades | JWT only | N/A | Rate limiting |
| Deposit funds | Wallet signature | No fallback | Amount verification |
| Request withdrawal | Wallet signature | No fallback | Balance check |
| View balance | JWT only | N/A | User ID match |
| View history | JWT only | N/A | User ID match |

## 8. Deployment Architecture

## 15. Conclusion

This architecture provides a pragmatic approach to building a verifiable trading game for the Aptos hackathon. By keeping chart generation off-chain initially, we can deliver a smooth user experience with 65ms updates while using Aptos for what it does best: secure, transparent financial settlement. The clear migration path to Shelby Protocol ensures that trust assumptions can be progressively removed without rebuilding the system.

The key insight is that users care more about gameplay smoothness and fair settlements than the technical details of randomness generation. By focusing on user experience first and decentralization second, we can build something people actually want to use, then improve its trust model based on real user feedback.
